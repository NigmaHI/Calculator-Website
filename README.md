# Calculator Website

I created a beginner-friendly calculator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on providing a simple yet functional calculator interface, making it an ideal starting point for anyone new to web development. By building this calculator, you can learn the basics of structuring web pages with HTML, styling them with CSS, and adding interactive functionality with JavaScript.
